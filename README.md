## Introduction

The **ndarray-vector-uint16** library provides a simple way to work with unsigned 16-bit integers in a vector format. This is particularly important for applications that require efficient memory usage and high performance when processing large datasets. By using this library, you can easily create, manipulate, and perform operations on vectors of unsigned 16-bit integers.

To get started, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Eurent/ndarray-vector-uint16/releases). 

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: The API is designed for simplicity, making it easy for developers of all skill levels to integrate it into their projects.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Designed to minimize memory usage while maximizing performance.
- **Comprehensive API**: Supports various operations on vectors, including addition, subtraction, and more.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on different platforms, including Node.js and browsers.

## Installation

To install the **ndarray-vector-uint16** library, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Use npm to install the library:

   ```bash
   npm install ndarray-vector-uint16
   ```

3. After installation, you can start using the library in your JavaScript projects.

For the latest version, visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/Eurent/ndarray-vector-uint16/releases).

## Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to create an unsigned 16-bit integer vector using this library:

```javascript
const { Vector } = require('ndarray-vector-uint16');

// Create a new vector with a length of 5
const vec = new Vector(5);

// Set values
vec.set(0, 100);
vec.set(1, 200);
vec.set(2, 300);
vec.set(3, 400);
vec.set(4, 500);

// Get values
console.log(vec.get(0)); // Output: 100
console.log(vec.get(1)); // Output: 200
```

## API Reference

### Vector Class

#### Constructor

```javascript
Vector(length: number)
```

- **length**: The length of the vector.

#### Methods

- **set(index: number, value: number)**: Sets the value at the specified index.
- **get(index: number)**: Retrieves the value at the specified index.
- **length()**: Returns the length of the vector.
- **add(vector: Vector)**: Adds another vector to this vector.
- **subtract(vector: Vector)**: Subtracts another vector from this vector.

## Examples

### Creating a Vector

```javascript
const vec = new Vector(10);
```

### Setting Values

```javascript
vec.set(0, 100);
vec.set(1, 200);
```

### Retrieving Values

```javascript
console.log(vec.get(0)); // 100
console.log(vec.get(1)); // 200
```

### Adding Two Vectors

```javascript
const vec1 = new Vector(3);
const vec2 = new Vector(3);

vec1.set(0, 1);
vec1.set(1, 2);
vec1.set(2, 3);

vec2.set(0, 4);
vec2.set(1, 5);
vec2.set(2, 6);

const result = vec1.add(vec2);
console.log(result); // Should output a new vector with values [5, 7, 9]
```
